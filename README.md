# base-app



A base Rails 4 application. Features user and admin system with Facebook login. It is instadeployable to Heroku.

The view is implemented using [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Here's a [live demo](http://rt-baseapp.herokuapp.com/). Just note that environment variables for Facebook login are not set so logging in that way will not work.

### Setting up

- Make sure you have Ruby 2.0.0.
- Install dependencies from Gemfile: `bundle install --path .bundle`.
- Create your `config/database.yml`, create the database and run the migrations.
- For Facebook login to work, export environment variables `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`.
- When creating a new app from this one, you will want to change
  `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` and set `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`
  (see `config/initializers/devise.rb`).
