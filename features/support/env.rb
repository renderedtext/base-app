  # By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
  # to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how
  # your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will
  # be rendered instead.
  #
  # Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
  # exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
  # Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
  # There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
  #
  # 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
  #
  # 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
  # recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!
